This paper mentions 25 heuristics that that can be used together to create a linear combination. We could potentially use these heuristics in unison to create the evaluation function.

These heuristics can be grouped depending on the state of the game. For instance, some heuristics would be more useful during the early-mid game, whereas other heuristics would be only useful for the end game. The paper suggests that this performs the strongest out of their options.

Selection is managed by tournaments. winners of two tournaments are coupled and crossbred.

Crossover is managed by a random partition of its coefficients, with random assignments from each parent. The offspring would replace the weakest specimen in the population. 

Mutation occurs here are simple math operations on the coefficients.

This paper discusses comparisons between the possible approaches that would improve the quality of weights on the neural network: Back Propagation and Genetic Algorithms. The comparisons would be measured using a Balance Scale.

The test data used was split into two sets. One set is used to feed into the neural network as training data, with its performance tested. The set is then used as test data for comparison.
Hidden layers are necessary for the comparison in order to make the comparison fair.

This paper deals with creating a Checkers Bot (Blondie24) that is based on a neural network that only considers the position of the pieces on the board.
It's AI takes the following approach:
