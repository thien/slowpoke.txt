abstract = {This report presents Giraffe, a chess engine that uses self-play to discover all its domain-specific knowledge, with minimal hand-crafted knowledge given by the programmer. Unlike previous attempts using machine learning only to perform parameter-tuning on hand-crafted evaluation functions, Giraffe's learning system also performs automatic feature extraction and pattern recognition. The trained evaluation function performs comparably to the evaluation functions of state-of-the-art chess engines - all of which containing thousands of lines of carefully hand-crafted pattern recognizers, tuned over many years by both computer chess experts and human chess masters. Giraffe is the most successful attempt thus far at using end-to-end machine learning to play chess.},

abstract = {A new method of genetic evolution of linear and nonlinear evaluation functions in the game of checkers is presented. Several practical issues concerning application of genetic algorithms for this task are pointed out and discussed. Experimental results confirm that proposed approach leads to efficient evaluation functions comparable to the ones used in some of commercial applications. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

@article{Schaeffer1996,
abstract = {In 1962, a checkers-playing program written by Arthur Samuel defeated a self-proclaimed master player, creating a sensation at the time for the fledgling field of computer science called artificial intelligence. The historical record refers to this event as having solved the game of checkers. This paper discusses achieving three different levels of solving the game: publicly (as evidenced by Samuel's results), practically (by the checkers program Chinook , the best player in the world) and provably (by consid-ering the 5 Ã— 10 20 positions in the search space). The latter definition may be attainable in the near future.},

abstract = {This chapter examines the expertise of Blondie24 in playing games. Blondie24 played more than 110 out of 165 on zone.com for six weeks. Overall, she played 84 games as red and 81 as white in which her average rating was 2,045.85 with a standard deviation of 33.94. After 165 games, the trajectory had stabilized, and Blondie was clearly declared an expert. As a result, Blondie's got a place in top 500 out of 12,000 registered players on zone.com. Blondie was better than 99.61 percent of all the rated players at the website. Blondie made a remarkable 84 wins, 20 draws, and 11 losses when played against the opponents who were rated below 2,000. Moreover, Blondie had 10 wins, 12 draws, and 22 losses when played with the opponents rated from 2,000 to 2,200. When Blondie played with other professionals, she won 31.25 percent of her games.},
