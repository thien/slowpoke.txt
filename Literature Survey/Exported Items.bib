	abstract = {Despite two decades of intensive research, it remains a challenge to design a practical anonymous two-factor authentication scheme, for the designers are confronted with an impressive list of security requirements (e.g., resistance to smart card loss attack) and desirable attributes (e.g., local password update). Numerous solutions have been proposed, yet most of them are shortly found either unable to satisfy some critical security requirements or short of a few important features. To overcome this unsatisfactory situation, researchers often work around it in hopes of a new proposal (but no one has succeeded so far), while paying little attention to the fundamental question: whether or not there are inherent limitations that prevent us from designing an “ideal” scheme that satisfies all the desirable goals? In this work, we aim to provide a definite answer to this question. We first revisit two foremost proposals, i.e. Tsai et al.'s scheme and Li's scheme, revealing some subtleties and challenges in designing such schemes. Then, we systematically explore the inherent conflicts and unavoidable trade-offs among the design criteria. Our results indicate that, under the current widely accepted adversarial model, certain goals are beyond attainment. This also suggests a negative answer to the open problem left by Huang et al. in 2014. To the best of knowledge, the present study makes the first step towards understanding the underlying evaluation metric for anonymous two-factor authentication, which we believe will facilitate better design of anonymous two-factor protocols that offer acceptable trade-offs among usability, security and privacy.},

	abstract = {Due to the recent security infringement incidents of single factor authentication services, there is an inclination towards the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms. These MFA mechanisms should be available to use on modern hand-held computing devices like smart phones due to their big share in computational devices market. Moreover, the high social acceptability and ubiquitous nature has attracted the enterprises to offer their services on modern day hand-held devices. In this regard, the big challenge for these enterprises is to ensure security and privacy of users. To address this issue, we have implemented a verification system that combines human inherence factor (handwritten signature biometrics) with the standard knowledge factor (user specific passwords) to achieve a high level of security. The major computational load of the aforementioned task is shifted on a cloud based application server so that a platform-independent user verification service with ubiquitous access becomes possible. Custom applications are built for both the iOS and Android based devices which are linked with the cloud based two factor authentication (TFA) server. The system is tested on-the-run by a diverse group of users and 98.4\% signature verification accuracy is achieved.},

We have validated experimentally this architecture by developing a middleware that can be used with any cloud storage provider that makes use of the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication and authorization. The middleware enables the use of two-factor authentication and encryption mechanisms to ensure the privacy of the data, in this paper the YubiKey USB cryptographic token is used as the external two-factor module.},

This trend is predetermined by the fact that various applications facilitate situational awareness and optimize data exchange between multiple actors. Yet the use of new technologies should be considered in the context of the applicable legal framework. Therefore, in this contribution, we discuss the applicability of the European data protection framework and its key principles related to online disaster management, and in particular, the processing of personal data when responding to disasters. The contribution provides examples of issues arising from the use of mobile apps.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, data storage requirements from end-users are growing, demanding more capacity, more reliability and the capability to access information from anywhere. Cloud storage services meet this demand by providing transparent and reliable storage solutions. Most of these solutions are built on distributed infrastructures that rely on data redundancy to guarantee a 100\% of data availability. Unfortunately, existing redundancy schemes very often assume that resources are homogeneous, an assumption that may increase storage costs in heterogeneous infrastructures – e.g., clouds built of voluntary resources. In this work, we analyze how distributed redundancy schemes can be optimally deployed over heterogeneous infrastructures. Specifically, we are interested in infrastructures where nodes present different online availabilities. Considering these heterogeneities, we present a mechanism to measure data availability more precisely than existing works. Using this mechanism, we infer the optimal data placement policy that reduces the redundancy used, and then its associated overheads. In heterogeneous settings, our results show that data redundancy can be reduced up to 70\%.},

	abstract = {The benefits of resorting to the cloud, as an efficient way to provide services, have long been recognised in the academic and industrial literature. However, as more and more companies are beginning to embrace the trend, it has also become clearer that the model offers unprecedented opportunities to cybercriminals: either by enabling them to compromise a myriad of services in a single shot or by allowing cyber-criminals to amplify their capabilities through a leverage of the technology offered by the cloud. This paper highlights the importance of an informed choice of a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) in minimising one's exposure to the insecurity of a cloud context. The paper proposes a well-defined approach, known as the Complete-Auditable-Reportable or C.A.RE, as a way to minimise one's exposure to the insecurity we live within the cloud. The C.A.RE approach helps to determine the adequacy of a CSP sponsored security by assessing its completeness in addressing most, if not all, risks that a service may be exposed to; the potential of that security to be adapted upon the identification of a security vulnerability during an audit, and how transparently such information is shared with the concerned Cloud Service Consumer (CSC). A level of assurance is associated to each of the C.A.RE parameters in order to help determine the overall trustworthiness of a CSP. The analysis and comparison of the C.A.RE approach to a well-known guideline as the Cloud Service Security Alliance guidelines, reveals that C.A.RE offers a clear and efficient way in determining a Trusted Cloud Service.},
