Problem Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this project is to explore alternative approaches to tackle
 the game of English Draughts via the use of contemporary machine learning
 techniques.
 We will be measuring their relative performance against historical implementati
ons, and explore the different attributes of the system in order to optimise
 its output.

Themes

\begin_layout Standard
Checkers occupies a fundamental place in game theory - It is the most complex
 game ever solved to date.

\begin_layout Standard
Historically, Draughts has been used as a testing ground for artificial
 intelligence since the concept.
 In 1959, Arthur Samuel devised a playing algorithm for Draughts.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Samuel2000"

\end_inset

 His algorithm revolved around using a linear combination of several weighted
 features the board contained.
 Samuel also described an early concept of what is now coined as Alpha Beta
 Pruning.
 The weights were then trained by the algorithm playing itself.
 Later investigation by a checkers magazine evaluated Samuel's player to

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Schaeffer took this further and produced a paper in 1992 describing how
 Checkers can be solved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To date, the game of draughts has been described to be weakly solved by
 Schaeffer et al.
 in 1996 with their introduction of Chinook.
 As of writing, Chinook remains the worlds strongest American checkers player.
 This was made possible by using a vast database of games played by grandmasters.
 Chinook also uses a dictionary of end games, for all possible moves for
 a board containing at most 8 pieces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Schaeffer took this further and finally proved a weak solution to Draughts
 after 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{14}$
\end_inset

 calculations of end game positions, with less than 10 pieces on the board.
 Shaeffer then goes on to prove, using numerical calculations that for two
 draughts players making no wrong moves, the game always ends in a draw.

\begin_layout Standard
In 2001, B.
 Fogel and Cheliapelia took a different approach towards playing draughts
 using feed-forward convolutional neural networks and genetic algorithms.
 Their resulting player, Blondie24
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Fogel2001"

\end_inset

 reached an average ELO rating of 1901.
 This was accomplished by using a feed-forward neural network that takes
 in 32 inputs (each input representing a position on the board), with a
 single output.
 Two hidden layers exist between the input and output layers.
 This resulting neural network was used to evaluate the status of the board,
 determining the overall performance scaling from -1 to 1 that suggests
 which player has the advantage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A variety of methods to either play the game of draughts, or to determine
 its solvability has been devised.
 The use of genetic algorithms has been commonly overshadowed by other contempor
ary methods in Machine Learning.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sergei Perez (UC Irvine) describes the use of genetic algorithms to evolve
 weights for a convolutional neural network as a more performant alternative
 to back-propagation, in nearly all situations, other than when the number
 of generations generated for neural networks are small.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
M.
 Kusiak, K.
 Waledzik and J.
 Mandziuk have devised the use of pure genetic algorithms as the premise
 to evaluate the board.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kusiak2007"

\end_inset

 they describe the use of 25 heuristics that, when used in unison, can determine
 the evaluation of a given board.
 They continue to go further on and specify that various combinations of
 heuristics, when used in different stages of the game, prove to be the
 most promising of outcomes.

\begin_layout Standard
Nelis Franken and Andries Engelbrecht similarly used draughtsboards as an
 evaluator for their rendition of an AI through Particle Swarm Optimisations.

\begin_layout Standard
In 2016, J.
 Quetzalcoatl Toledo-Marin et al.
 performed studies on attacking strategies using the game of checkers as
 a reference (which however can be applied to any other zero-sum game)

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using genetic algorithms to improve neural networks is not a novel feature.
 In 2017 Lingxi Xie et al.
 discussed using genetic algorithms to compute optimal deep learning structures
 automatically, using an image recognition dataset as the benchmark for
 competitiveness against the networks.

\begin_layout Section
Proposed Direction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The approach taken would follow the a similar framework as described for
 Blondie24, but we will be considering seperate weights for the different
 stages of the game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like Blondie24, a convolutional neural network would be used to evaluate
 the board.
 However, it is undecided whether to use one network with three outputs,
 or to have separate neural networks that will evaluate the board contingent
 on the phase of the game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The genetic algorithm would be used to improve the quality of the weights
 of the neural networks.
 We will need a population of neural networks (which have varying weights),
 with a round-robin style tournament as the evaluation function.
 Finalists are chosen as the basis for the next generation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Experimentation of techniques would be conducted in these areas, and I could
 imagine that they would be tested independently of each other.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An interface is also needed in order to test the AI.
 There are multiple options for this; It could be built for the web, which
 would interact with the AI, or we can simply use a program built locally
 for it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to test it's performance, we could, like Chellapilla and Fogel's
 paper, make an account for the AI at a popular gaming site and act as the
 intermediary for it.
 This would provide a lot of benefits, such as a relative ELO amongst other
 players on the site.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considerations will need to be made such that the game does not strictly
 overtrain itself to play in a particular manner.
