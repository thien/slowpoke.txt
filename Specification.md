Specification
Title:
Using Genetic Algorithms to evolve a Neural Network based Draughts Player

Degree:
Computer Science

Description:
Draughts AI players are currently designed to play at a fixed ability. While it has produced very competitive and intelligent players, they require tweaks in order to improve its performance. By combining Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms, this issue could possibly be solved by creating a player that can grow in ability over time.

Preliminary Preparation:

- A cohesive understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks
- A primer on Checkers
- A comprehensive understanding of Genetic Algorithms
- A comprehensive understanding of relevant programming languages/frameworks.

Minimum Objectives

- A complete list of heuristics 
- A functioning neural network 
- An initially working Draughts AI
- An interface to play against the Draughts AI

Intermediate Objectives

- The Neural Network is evolved using a genetic algorithm
- A Web interface for contestants to play against the Draughts AI
- The AI can play to a competency of at least 1200 ELO.

Advanced Objectives

- The Evolutionary Neural Network would be ranked at least 1800 ELO.
- A comprehensive analysis of the performance of the AI as it is improved.
