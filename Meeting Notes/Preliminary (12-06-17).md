Meeting Notes

Preliminary Meeting
12 June 2017 
- This has already been done, how far should i differentiate my project from it?
  - Apply GA to the min-max algorithm or the Neural Network? (The original project had the GA evolve on the neural network, with the NN being the linear combination of its heuristics)
- Making the neural network from scratch or is it okay to use libraries such as TensorFlow?
- Making the Draughts Interface from scratch or using a framework?


- In relation to the actual algorithm used to find the next move (min-max algorithm):
  - Use alpha-beta pruning?
- In relation to the Neural Network:
  - Inputs to be Heuristics, output to be linear combination as part of the evaluation function for the min/max algorithm?
- In relation to be Genetic Algorithm:
  - Population to be the Neural Networks?
