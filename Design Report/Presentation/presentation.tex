    % Why is it important?
    % Currently (except for AlphaGo Zero) are really good at exploiting human games and definining "intuition" from there.
    Presently, competitive Draughts AI players are currently designed to play at a fixed ability. \\
    While it has produced very competitive and intelligent players, they require manual modifications in order to improve its performance. This is due to their dependency on pre-defined move databases, where optimal moves are pre-calculated, and recalled when necessary. \\
    By combining Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms, this issue could possibly be solved by creating a player that can grow in ability over time, without the dependency on move-banks.

    - Enjoyed the AI Search module \\
    - Want to learn about Machine Learning (unfortunately not an option this year) \\
    - I love board games! \\

    % Interested in neural networks, really enjoyed AI Search submodule. Inherent competitiveness against peers
    % Not necessarily interested in solving something new; also not expected for a bachelors degree.
